# Band-Project

This project is for a Software Engineering class at Geneva College. We are developing an interface to view and edit data
involving the band program which includes instruments, students, and other logable data. This project is being developed
using ASP.NET MVC


#Problems the came up with our Program

1. An attempt was made at having an option of uploading a Microsoft Excel sheet to our website that would then read the data in the cells and store it into the database in the appropriate fields. 
  1. A way of uploading files is in place with a controller called ImportDataController and a view to accompany it,     however there is no actual system set up in the code to read the data that is passed in. 

#STUFF YOU WANT TO KNOW

1. Entity Framework is bad. 
2. Do not be afraid to ask for help.
3. You NEED to spend more than 1 hour a week on this project.
